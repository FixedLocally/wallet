# wallet

Primitive Solana wallet.

## Unaudited Software - Use at your own risk
Best faith effort was made to ensure that your keys will never be printed to the console or uploaded somewhere.
Still, best faith effort is not always enough.

## Running
You need [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) to run this app.
If you are an iOS user, you will need XCode and an Apple account to install the app, for Android users `flutter run` will do.

## Todo
- [ ] Migrate dialogs to bottom sheets and better buttons
- [ ] Reset seed phrase
- [ ] Confirmation dialog for showing keys
